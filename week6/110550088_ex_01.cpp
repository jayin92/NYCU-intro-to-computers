     * Read the input file sentence by sentence until end of file. We process one line and output one line.
     * Hint: For each line, there is '\n' and then '\0' in the end. However, we do not process '\n'.
     * How to move '\0' to get rid of it?
     * 
	 * First, we parse the input signal sentence, that is, we cut the input signals to parts. 
     * Each part can be converted into one english letter by the mapping we has built.
     * Hence you might need a 2d array with row indicating how many parts you cut and column
     * indicating the length of each part.
     *
     * Now you can start parsing the input signal sentence. Consider two case when you need to cut:
     * 1) "..."   2) "......."
     * However, you never know you are reading one dot in a three dots sequence or not until you have read three (or seven) dots. 
     * You can first append the input character to your 2d array (column index++) no matter the dots, and count the cumulated number of dots
     * at the same time. (if this character is '.', you add one to the cumulated number of dots. If not, reset to 0)
     *
     * Later if you find that the cumulated number of dots is:
     * 1) 3: you know it is a pause between english letters. Remember to delete those three dots
     *    Hint: you can do deletion by placing '\0' at just right place
     * 2) 7: you know it is a pause between english words. Remember to delete those seven dots and add " " 
	 *    Hint: you can do it by replacing whole string with " " (space)
	 * Finally, you then move to finding next part of input signals (row index++)
